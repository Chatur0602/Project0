README
  Drone Review is a website that shows you the latest drones from DJI's lineup and talks about what they're all about and who they're for. It also includes 2 main scrollable divs, one with all of its Specifications & Features and one with a Detailed Review. It also contains a slideshow of images on each page to highlight each drone's exterior features & qualities. The main idea of this website is to help newbie pilots to find a drone that suits their needs best.

DETAILS FOR INSTRUCTOR 
  Here I'd like to highlight some of the things I've done in respect to the requirements for this project to make it easier for the instructor to grade me (Refer to https://docs.cs50.net/web/2020/x/projects/0/project0.html for the list of requirements). They are as follows: 
	
	1st Requirement: Yes, I have 4 HTML pages that can navigate to each other using the help of a bootstrap class(BreadCrumb)
	
	2nd Requirement: Yes, My website does contain at least one Ordered/Unordered List. 
	
	3rd Requirement: Yes, My website does contain at least one Stylesheet(.css) File. 

	4th Requirement: Yes, My website does contain at least 5 different CSS properties, and at least 5 different types of CSS selectors. 
	
	5th Requirement: Yes, My website does contain at least one mobile-responsive @media query, such that something about the styling changes for smaller screens(however I did notice it is still a little glitchy and doesn't work very well, this is one function that i wasn't able to complete 100%, you may cut marks). 

	6th Requirement: Yes, my website does implement Bootstrap 4 & uses at least 1 bootstrap component as well as contains 3 columns implementing grid layout on the index.html page (Not on all pages). 

	7th Requirement: Yes, my Stylesheet does use at least one SCSS variable, at least one example of SCSS nesting, and at least one use of SCSS inheritance in the index.css stylesheet (Not on all pages).

	8th Requirement: You are currently reading the 8th requirement, which is a README.md file, hope this helped you get a little more clarity towards my website :).
