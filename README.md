README
  Drone Review is a website that shows you the latest drones from DJI's lineup and talks about what they're all about and who they're for. It also includes 2 main scrollable divs, one with all of its Specifications & Features and one with a Detailed Review. It also contains a slideshow of images on each page to highlight each drone's exterior features & qualities. The main idea of this website is to help newbie pilots to find a drone that suits their needs best.
